# **Robotic Hand – Remote VLSI Inspection Assistive Device**

### *By Mohammed Jahangir (GitHub: **pingjahangir**) — Trainee Engineer, Guidsoft Technologies Pvt. Ltd.*

This repository showcases a humanoid **robotic hand prototype** designed and developed by **pingjahangir**, aimed at enabling experts to **remotely inspect VLSI chips** using a sensor-based gesture control system.

The project replicates human finger motion using **flex sensors**, **servo motors**, and a fully **3D-printed InMoov-based** mechanical hand.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project, developed by **pingjahangir**, focuses on creating a low-cost robotic hand capable of mirroring real-time human finger movements. The system uses a glove embedded with flex sensors and an Arduino-based control unit that actuates servo motors on the robotic hand.

This work forms part of the research and prototyping efforts during my training period at **Guidsoft Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

## ⚙️ **How the System Works**

1. Flex sensors detect finger bending and send analog values
2. Arduino reads the flex data and maps it to servo angles
3. Servo motors pull nylon tendons attached to each finger
4. The 3D-printed robotic hand mimics real-time human motion
5. Entire interaction was calibrated and tested by **pingjahangir**
